## Project Title

Prevalence of Chronic Conditions by Demographic Characteristics: A Comparative Analysis

## Project Description and Outline

Chronic disease is a condition that lasts for a year or more and requires ongoing medical attention and limits the activities of daily living. Some common examples of chronic diseases include: cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and arthritis. Chronic diseases impose a significant burden on individuals, healthcare systems, and society as a whole. To address this public health challenge, this project aims to explore the prevalence of chronic conditions and their associations with demographic regions.

By examining the patterns and relationships between chronic conditions and demographic characteristics, we can gain insights into the distribution, impact, and potential disparities of these conditions within specific populations.In addition to data collection, we would be performing data Cleaning, descriptive Analysis, comparative Analysis and geospatial analysis.

## Research Questions to Answer

1. Are there any relationships between specific demographics groups (age, gender, race) that influence the prevalence of multiple chronic medical conditions within a population? 
2. How do environmental factors/ genetic predispositions relate to the individual development of chronic medical conditions (meaning are these diseases mostly prevalent in a specific group in a specific place)?
3. What areas have the highest / lowest prevalence of multiple chronic conditions?
4. How has the prevalence of multiple chronic conditions changed in recent years? Does access to the treatment for conditions have anything to do with this change?
5. What are the risk factors for prevalence of multiple chronic conditions?
6. What are the most common causes of chronic conditions?
7. Are there any implementations to improve or prevent multiple chronic conditions?
8. What are the alternatives for multiple chronic conditions treatments/ are these treatments available for public health and how are they demographically distributed?
9. What are the demographics on the highest rates of chronic conditions? 

## Breakdown tasks and deadlines
